      <p style="color: red;">This div includes the links to various pages but there s no proper interface to account for the links 
          and navigation, whcih is a bad practice. A webpage should have everything easily available - discoverability.

          discoverability is very important in a website because it ensures that user has a good user experience. 
          This probably a bright red color of the etxt is also not helping because it just hurts the eyes over the blue background.

          1. There is no concept of header or footer making the orientation really bad of the page. A bad orientation 
          of website creates a bad interface
      </p>
      <p>
          2. No concept of grid makes the page cluttered and messy
      </p>
      <p>
          3. Adding pictures is important, but without giving the picture a good effect, the "captivating template" is not 
          created. Also, the picture should be adjusted such that a certain type of template is created, which has not been done here
      </p>
      <p>
          4. Another rule is to pay attention to the color palette. A bright blue background with text in green color
          is not a good choice of color paletter because it makes it hard for the ciewers to read and does not account 
          for viewers with visual defects.

          5. The title of the webpage is "webpage" which is not informative at all. - Titles

      <p>Over all, here are the some of the main rules broken in the website. Now this is just an unnecessaryily long paragraph
          which is a bad practice. People like to read shorter sentences, or at least not this long. Now I am just writng somehting
            to increase the paragraph length, to show how boring and cluttered a long paragraph 
            on a website makes it looks. There should be longer pages, sure, because it makes the page have an overall good interface. 
            With long pages, there should be shorter sentences, this ensures - engagement.

            "Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph."

      <p> this is like the worst website i have every developed even including when i did not even know html and css. This is just 
          giving me, (with no visual defects or anything), a seizure and headache looking at the blue screen with the font size 
          so small. There is no <u>consistency</u> in the page
