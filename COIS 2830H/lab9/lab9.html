    <!-- 1 - Adding 3 new tracks -->
    <figure>
        <h2 style="color: blueviolet;"> 1. Adding 3 new tracks </h2>
        <img src = "./Images/newtrack.jpg" float = "true">
        <figcaption style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; color: blue; font-size: 1.2rem;"> In the photo, in the left column, three rows can be seen. These are the 3 new tracks I have added. 
            We can see the option of fx, mute, trim, soloed, phase normal and the volume buttons for each track. 
        This is how we edit each track (independently). </figcaption>

    <!-- 2 - Searching for Reverb plugin in Fx  -->
    <figure>
        <h2 style="color: blueviolet;"> 2.1. Searching for Reverb plugin in Fx (with filter) </h2>
        <img src = "./Images/filterfx.jpg" float = "true">
        <figcaption style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; color: blue; font-size: 1.2rem;"> When clicked on the fx window (as discussed in the previous photo), many plugins can be seen. Using the filter option, it was possible to find a 
            Reverb plugin. In the seacrh bar for filter, I wrote Reverb plugin, and hence was able to find it. The highlighted plugin is the Reverb Plugin. </figcaption>
        <h2 style="color: blueviolet;"> 2.2. Searching for Reverb plugin in Fx (without filter) </h2>
        <img src = "./Images/fx.jpg" float = "true">
        <figcaption style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; color: blue; font-size: 1.2rem;"> Using filter is probabl a good and faster way, however, one can try to find a Reverb plugin just by scrolling through all the list of 
            the plugins. I could see the Reverb plugin eaily at one glance, so I thought of highlighting it like that and taking a screenshot of this (where I didn't use a filter) as well.</figcaption>

    <!-- 3 - Media Explorer -->
    <figure>
        <h2 style="color: blueviolet;"> 3. Media Explorer </h2>
        <img src = "./Images/mediexplorer.jpg" float = "true">
        <figcaption style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; color: blue; font-size: 1.2rem;"> The option to open Media explorer was found in the View dropdown. The shortcut is Ctrl+shift+X (for windows). It opens a window at the bottom of the 
            screen. As the name suggests and as it is clear, the media explorer is used to find a track that one might want to drop in the Reaper.  </figcaption>

   <!-- 4 - adding track in new track -->
   <figure>
    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;"> 4. Adding track in new track </h2>
    <img src = "./Images/addsound.jpg" float = "true">
    <figcaption style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400; color: blue; font-size: 1.2rem;"> I had downloaded the sound track given in the lab9 zip file and I just dragged and dropped it onto the first track. The first track has all the lines and 
        everything on the right side. Comparing the first screenshot to this, it is cear that the soundtrack has been successfully added. On playing the soundtrack, 
    we can hear the track, meaning, it has been successfully added and is working. Yay, lab9 done.  </figcaption>
